			<p>FC Barcelona’s 2014/15 season is underway. This Tuesday Luis Enrique led his men in two training sessions at the Ciutat Esportiva with the help of the members of his staff. Here’s a look at Luis Enrique’s most trusted men:</p><br>
			<p><strong>Juan Carlos Unzué</strong>, assistant manager. The former FC Barcelona keeper, who featured 36 times for the Club, kicks off his third term in a managerial position at Barça. From 2003 to 2010 he was the first team’s keeper trainer. During the 2010/11 season he was Numancia’s manager, and then he returned to Barça to take up his old post during the 2012/13 season. He was Luis Enrique’s assistant manager last season at Celta Vigo.</p>
			<p><strong>Roberto Moreno</strong>, second manager. This will be Moren’s fourth time managing a team under Luis Enrique. He was part of the Barça B staff four years ago, and he also accompanied Luis Enrique to Rome and Vigo.</p>
			<p>Joan Barbarà, auxiliary coach. Barbarà, who was Eusebio’s assistant coach last season, swaps the Miniestadi for the Camp Nou. The former Sabadell and Salamanca player was Luis Enrique’s assistant coach at Barça B from 2008 to 2011.</p>
			<p><strong>Rafa Pol</strong>, physical trainer. Pol worked with Luis Enrique during the manager’s time at Roma and Celta. This will be the third time they’ve worked together.</p>
			<p><strong>Joaquín Valdés</strong>, psychologist. Like Moreno, this is Valdés’ fourth stint with Luis Enrique. In addition to helping the manager at Roma and Celta, he also was Barça B’s psychologist.</p>
			<p><strong>José Ramón de la Fuente</strong>, goalkeeper trainer. This is the former Barça B player’s third season at the Club in a training capacity. After working for Tito Vilanova and Gerardo Martino, he will continue on at Luis Enrique’s goalkeeper trainer.</p>
